# 🎮 GameQuest – SQL Video Game Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
GameQuest is a standalone SQL project where I created and analyzed a video game dataset to practice exploratory and intermediate-to-advanced SQL techniques.

The project focuses on extracting insights using ranking, aggregation, trend analysis, and performance classification — all using pure SQL.

## 📊 Dataset Description

Table name: `games`

Columns:
- id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
- title (TEXT)
- genre (TEXT)
- platform (TEXT)
- rating (REAL)
- release_year (INTEGER)

The dataset was manually created for learning and portfolio purposes.

## 📂 Files in This Repository

This repository contains the following SQL files:

- **GameQuest DATA FILE.sql**  
  Contains the INSERT statements used to populate the `games` table.

- **GameQuest FINAL REPO.sql**  
  Contains all finalized analytical queries and insights.

- **GameQuest SAMPLE ANALYSIS.sql**  
  Includes exploratory and practice queries created during development.

- **GameQuest WORKING REPO.sql**  
  Working draft version of queries before final cleanup

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore available genres and platforms
- Identify top-rated games
- Rank games within each platform
- Analyze yearly release trends
- Compare platform performance
- Identify games above platform average
- Calculate percentile rankings

## 🛠 SQL Concepts Used

- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- DISTINCT
- GROUP BY & HAVING
- CASE statements
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions
- Ranking Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
- Running Totals

## 🔍 Sample Business Questions Answered

- Which platforms have the highest average-rated games?
- What are the top-rated games per platform?
- How many games were released each year and cumulatively?
- Which games perform above their platform’s average?
- How do individual games rank percentile-wise across the dataset?
- How can platforms be categorized based on rating performance?

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Create the `games` table using the CREATE TABLE script inside the SQL files.
2. Run **GameQuest DATA FILE.sql** to insert data.
3. Execute queries from **GameQuest FINAL REPO.sql** for analysis.
4. (Optional) Review development queries in SAMPLE and WORKING files.
